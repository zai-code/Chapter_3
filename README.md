# Chapter_3


In this chapter, I learned the fundamentals of Dart language. I discovered how to add comments to my code to make it clearer and learned about the main() function, which is what kicks off the app. I also found out how to declare variables for different types of values like numbers, strings, Booleans, and lists. I used a List to keep an array of filters and figured out how to loop through each item. Additionally, I examined the common operator symbols that help with math, comparisons, logic, conditions, andcascade notation. The cascade notation is a useful tool that allows you to perform multiple actions on the same object, like scaling and positioning it. I also  discovered that Dart code begins with a main() function. We can write single-line and multi-line comments to explain our code. I discovered how to bring in external packages, libraries, and classes by using the import statement. I also explored an example of asynchronous programming with a Future object. In this example, a simulated web server was called to check the total cookie count in the background, allowing the user to keep using the app without any breaks. In addition, I learned about using classes to bundle together code logic. These classes can hold data, like a barista's name and experience, and they also define functions that perform tasks, such as retrieving the experience of a barista.
