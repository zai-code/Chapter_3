# Chapter_3


In this chapter, I learned the fundamentals of Dart language. I discovered how to add comments to my code to make it clearer and learned about the main() function, which is what kicks off the app. I also found out how to declare variables for different types of values like numbers, strings, Booleans, and lists. I used a List to keep an array of filters and figured out how to loop through each item. Additionally, I examined the common operator symbols that help with math, comparisons, logic, conditions, andcascade notation. The cascade notation is a useful tool that allows you to perform multiple actions on the same object, like scaling and positioning it. I also  discovered that Dart code begins with a main() function. We can write single-line and multi-line comments to explain our code. Moving on to operators, we use arithmetic symbols like +, -, *, and /. For comparison, we have equality and relational operators such as ==, !=, <, and >. Logical operators include &&, ||, and !, and thereâ€™s also the cascade operator (..) that allows us to perform multiple operations on the same object. Also In the realm of classes and object-oriented concepts, we can create classes and instantiate objects. Inheritance lets us extend classes, while mixins help with code reuse. There are constructors, including named and factory constructors, to consider as well.
